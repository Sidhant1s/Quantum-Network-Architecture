# Adaptive and Secure Quantum Communication Framework

> ⚠️ **Conceptual Research Project**
> This project presents a theoretical framework for future-ready quantum communication infrastructure. It is **not implemented**, **not tested**, and **not verified in real-world systems**. All content here is for academic and proposal submission purposes only.

---

## 📄 Overview

This repository introduces a cutting-edge, **conceptual architecture** for secure and scalable global quantum communication. The idea is aimed at mitigating known quantum communication issues like photon loss, limited range, and interception risks.

Developed by **Sidhant Negi**, the framework combines software logic with physical-layer enhancements using:

* 📡 **QIRRP** – Quantum Internet Routing & Resilience Protocol
* 🧿 **QDDS** – Quantum Decoy Defense System
* 🔁 **QARP** – Quantum Adaptive Rerouting Protocol

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Component                     | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Photonic Clouding**         | Noise & decoys protect primary data photons.                |
| **Start-End Packet Tags**     | Ensures completeness & validity of quantum packets.         |
| **Selective Resend Protocol** | Only lost packets are retransmitted, not the whole message. |
| **Rerouting System**          | Detects tampering and dynamically reroutes data.            |
| **Quantum Repeaters**         | Nodes behave like smart relays & defense monitors.          |

## 🛰 Use Case Sectors

* **Defense (DRDO, ISRO)**: Military-grade tamper-proof communication.
* **Quantum Labs (IITs, BARC, TIFR)**: Experiment relay with real-time re-routing.
* **Startups**: Concept for next-gen quantum-secure products in finance, health, space, and AI.
